## Flutter: Upgrading old projects

---

### Basic Approach

- Ensure the Flutter development environment is up to date.
- Create a new Flutter project in a new folder using the original's naming properties.
- Migrate the old project's assets, code, permissions & keys the new project.
- Deal with remaining issues.
